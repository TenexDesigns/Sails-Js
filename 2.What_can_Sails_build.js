Sails.js is a full-featured web application framework built on top of Node.js.
It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and provides a set of conventions and tools to 
simplify the development of scalable and data-driven web applications. 
Heres an overview of Sails.js and what it can build:

Web Applications: Sails.js is well-suited for building various types of web applications, including:

Content Management Systems (CMS): Sails.js can handle the backend logic for managing content, including user authentication, CRUD operations, and data storage.

E-commerce Platforms: Sails.js can be used to develop e-commerce platforms with features like product listings, shopping carts, payment gateways, and order management.

Social Networking Sites: Sails.js provides real-time capabilities through its built-in support for WebSockets,
  making it suitable for building social networking sites with real-time notifications, messaging systems, and activity feeds.

Collaboration Tools: Sails.jss real-time functionality makes it a good choice for building collaboration tools like project management applications,
  shared document editing, or real-time chat applications.

Dashboards and Analytics: Sails.js can be used to build dashboards and analytics platforms that gather, process, and present data in real-time or through scheduled data updates.

RESTful APIs: Sails.js excels at building robust and scalable APIs. It provides a straightforward way to define routes,
  handle HTTP requests, and connect with databases. Sails.jss RESTful API capabilities make it a suitable choice for creating backend services 
  that power mobile applications, single-page applications, or integrations with other systems.

Real-time Applications: Sails.js offers built-in support for WebSockets, enabling bidirectional communication between the server and clients in real-time.
This makes it a great framework for building real-time applications like chat applications, real-time collaboration tools, multiplayer games, or live streaming applications.

Data-driven Applications: Sails.js includes a powerful object-relational mapping (ORM) called Waterline.
Waterline provides a consistent API to interact with various databases, including SQL, NoSQL, and more. 
With Waterline, you can easily define models, query data, and handle database operations, making Sails.js suitable for building data-driven applications such as CRM systems, 
  data management tools, or analytics platforms.

Rapid Prototyping: Sails.js embraces convention over configuration, meaning it comes with sensible defaults and conventions that reduce the amount of boilerplate code.
This allows for quick prototyping and getting an initial version of the application up and running rapidly.

Overall, Sails.js is a versatile framework that can be used to build a wide range of web applications, RESTful APIs, real-time applications,
  and data-driven systems. Its MVC architecture, real-time capabilities, and built-in ORM make it a powerful choice for developing scalable and feature-rich applications with Node.js.
