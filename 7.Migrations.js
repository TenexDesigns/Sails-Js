Sails.js does not have built-in support for database migrations like some other frameworks (e.g., Ruby on Rails or Laravel). However, you can still manage database schema changes manually or by using third-party packages. Here's how you can handle migrations in Sails.js:

Manually managing migrations:

Make sure your PostgreSQL database is running.
Once you have made changes to your models (created, modified, or deleted attributes), you need to manually update the database schema.
Use a database migration tool such as Knex.js or Sequelize.js to handle the migration process. These tools allow you to write scripts that can create, modify, or delete database tables and columns based on your model changes.
You can create migration scripts in a dedicated folder, for example, migrations, and keep track of the applied migrations yourself. Execute these scripts manually or use a script runner to apply the changes to the database.
Using a third-party package:

Alternatively, you can use a third-party package like sails-migrations or sails-db-migrate to handle database migrations in Sails.js.
These packages provide a way to define migrations and run them using Sails.js commands or custom scripts.
You can install and configure the package of your choice by following the documentation provided with the package.
Remember to backup your database before performing any migrations to avoid data loss.

It's important to note that managing database migrations manually or using third-party packages requires careful handling, especially in production environments, to ensure the integrity and consistency of your data. Make sure to thoroughly test your migration scripts and have a proper backup and rollback strategy in place.
