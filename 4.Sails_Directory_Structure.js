The directory structure of a typical Sails.js project follows a convention that helps organize the codebase and separates different components of the application. Here is a high-level overview of the directory structure:

api: This directory contains the applications controllers, models, policies, and services. It is the main directory where you will spend most of your time developing the application logic.

controllers: This directory contains the controllers that handle incoming requests, perform necessary actions, and send responses back to the client.

models: This directory holds the model definitions, representing the data structure and handling interactions with the database.

policies: This directory contains the policy definitions, which define rules for authorizing access to specific routes or actions.

services: This directory houses reusable services or utilities that can be used across the application.

config: This directory contains various configuration files for the Sails.js application.

env: This directory holds environment-specific configuration files, allowing you to customize settings for different deployment environments (e.g., development, production).

locales: If internationalization (i18n) is enabled, this directory contains translation files for different languages.

routes: This directory defines the routes for the application, mapping incoming requests to the appropriate controller actions.

custom.js: This file contains custom configuration options and settings for the Sails.js application.

assets: This directory is used for front-end assets, such as stylesheets, JavaScript files, images, and other static files. It is typically associated with the frontend framework (e.g., Angular, React) used alongside Sails.js.

views: This directory contains the view templates used for rendering HTML pages. Sails.js supports various view engines (e.g., EJS, Handlebars), and this directory holds the corresponding template files.

tasks: This directory holds custom Grunt tasks that can be used to automate certain build processes or perform specific actions.

test: This directory contains the unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests for the application.

assets, views, tasks, and test directories are not required for every Sails.js project, depending on the specific needs of the application.

Additionally, there are other files and directories at the root level of the project:

app.js: This file is the entry point of the Sails.js application. It initializes and starts the server, loads configuration files, and sets up the necessary components.

package.json: This file lists the project's dependencies, scripts, and other metadata. It is used by npm for package management and project setup.

sails.config.js: This file contains additional configuration options and settings for the Sails.js application that are not included in the config directory.

.sailsrc: This file is used to configure Sails.js CLI options and behavior.

This directory structure provides a logical separation of components and promotes maintainability and scalability in Sails.js projects. However, it's worth noting that the structure can be customized or extended based on the specific requirements of the application.

  *************************************************************************************************************************************************


The directory structure of a Sails.js application is organized according to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.
Heres a brief overview of the primary directories and their purposes in a Sails.js project developer.okta.com:

api/: This directory contains the core components of your application, including models, controllers, and policies.
api/controllers/: Contains the controllers that handle incoming requests and produce responses.
api/models/: Contains the models that define the structure of your application's data.
api/policies/: Contains the policies that control access to specific actions in your controllers.
api/services/: Contains reusable services that can be used across your application.
assets/: This directory contains the frontend assets of your application, such as stylesheets, JavaScript files, and images.
config/: Contains configuration files that define various settings for your application, such as database connections, routes, and security settings.
config/routes.js: Defines the routes for your application.
config/connections.js: Defines the database connections for your application.
config/models.js: Sets the default settings for your models.
config/policies.js: Configures the policies for your application.
tasks/: Contains task automation scripts for building and deploying your application.
views/: Contains the view templates that define the presentation layer of your application.
In addition to these primary directories, a Sails.js project may also include other directories and files,
  such as .tmp/ for temporary files, node_modules/ for third-party dependencies, and package.json for managing your application's metadata and dependencies.

When you create a new Sails.js project using the npx sails new command without the --no-frontend flag, the generated directory structure will include frontend-related directories like assets/, views/, and tasks/. However, if you create a new project using the npx sails new jobportal --no-frontend command,
  these frontend-related directories will not be generated, as the project is intended to be a backend-only application.
