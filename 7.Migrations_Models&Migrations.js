Migrations in Sails.js provide a way to manage and apply changes to your database schema over time. They allow you to perform tasks such as creating new tables, modifying existing tables (adding or removing columns), or executing any other database-specific operation required to keep your schema in sync with your application's models.

Here's how migrations, models, and generators are related and how they interact:

Migrations:

Migrations are scripts or files that define the changes to be applied to your database schema.
They are typically used to perform tasks like creating or modifying database tables, altering columns, adding or removing indexes, etc.
By using migration files, you have more control over the precise changes made to the database and can ensure consistency across different environments.
Models:

Models in Sails.js represent the logical structure of your application's data and provide an abstraction layer for interacting with the database.
They define the attributes, validations, associations, and business logic related to the corresponding database tables.
Models are typically used for querying, creating, updating, and deleting data in the database.
Migrations and models are related because changes made in migrations (such as creating or modifying tables) should align with the corresponding model definitions to ensure data integrity and consistency.
Generators:

Sails.js provides generators as a convenient way to scaffold code and generate the initial structure for models, controllers, services, etc.
However, Sails.js does not provide a built-in generator specifically for creating migrations.
You will need to manually create migration files in the specified directory, as mentioned earlier, or use a third-party package like sails-generate-migration to generate migration files.
To summarize, migrations allow you to make controlled changes to your database schema over time, while models provide an abstraction layer for interacting with the database tables. You can manually create migration files and modify them according to your needs, and you can use generators for other components like models and controllers, but there isn't a built-in generator specifically for migrations in Sails.js.
